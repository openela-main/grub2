Subject: [PATCH] powerpc: prefix detection: support device names with commas

Frustratingly, the device name itself can contain an embedded comma:
e.g /pci@800000020000015/pci1014,034A@0/sas/disk@5000c50098a0ee8b

So my previous approach was wrong: we cannot rely upon the presence
of a comma to say that a partition has been specified!

It turns out for prefixes like (,gpt2)/grub2 we really want to make
up a full (device,partition)/patch prefix, because root discovery code
in 10_linux will reset the root variable and use search to fill it again.
If you have run grub-install, you probably don't have search built in,
and if you don't have prefix containing (device,partition), grub will
construct ($root)$prefix/powerpc-ieee1275/search.mod - but because $root
has just been changed, this will no longer work, and the boot will fail!

Retain the gist of the logic, but instead of looking for a comma, look for
a leading '('. This matches the earlier code better anyway.

There's certainly a better fix to be had. But any time you chose to build
with a bare prefix like '/grub2', you're almost certainly going to build in
search anyway, so this will do.
