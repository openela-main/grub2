Subject: [PATCH] mm: grub_real_malloc(): Make small allocs comment match code

Small allocations move the region's *first pointer. The comment
says that this happens for allocations under 64K. The code says
it's for allocations under 32K. Commit 45bf8b3a7549 changed the
code intentionally: make the comment match.

Fixes: 45bf8b3a7549 (* grub-core/kern/mm.c (grub_real_malloc): Decrease cut-off of moving the)
