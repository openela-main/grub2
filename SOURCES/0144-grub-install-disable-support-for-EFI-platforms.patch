Subject: [PATCH] grub-install: disable support for EFI platforms

For each platform, GRUB is shipped as a kernel image and a set of
modules. These files are then used by the grub-install utility to
install GRUB on a specific device. However, in order to support UEFI
Secure Boot, the resulting EFI binary must be signed by a recognized
private key. For this reason, for EFI platforms, most distributions also
ship prebuilt EFI binaries signed by a distribution-specific private
key. In this case, however, the grub-install utility should not be used
because it would overwrite the signed EFI binary.

The current fix is suboptimal because it preserves all EFI-related code.
A better solution could be to modularize the code and provide a
build-time option.

Resolves: rhbz#1737444
